Task 1
Find the second-smallest number in an array

Task 2
Given two sorted arrays, the task is to merge them in a sorted manner.

Task 3
Reverse words in a given string

Task 4
Implement a string compression function that takes a string as input and prints the count of consecutive
occurrences of each unique character in the format "character_count." If a character appears only once,
simply print the character without a count.
For example, given the input "aabbbcc," the output should be "a2b3c2."

Task 5
Given a palindromic string, modify it by replacing exactly one character with the lexicographically smallest
lowercase English letter, such that the resulting string is not a palindrome.
If no such modification is possible, return an empty string.

Example: There are many ways to make "abccba" not a palindrome, such as "zbccba", "aaccba", and "abacba"
