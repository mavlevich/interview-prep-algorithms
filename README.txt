Task1
Find the second-smallest number in an array

Task2
Given two sorted arrays, the task is to merge them in a sorted manner.
        Examples:
        Input: arr1[] = { 1, 3, 4, 5}, arr2[] = {2, 4, 6, 8}
        Output: arr3[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8}

        Input: arr1[] = { 5, 8, 9}, arr2[] = {4, 7, 8}
        Output: arr3[] = {4, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9}

Task3
Reverse words in a given string
Example "I love programming" -> "programming love I"

Task4
Implement a string compression function that takes a string as input and prints the count of consecutive
occurrences of each unique character in the format "character_count." If a character appears only once,
simply print the character without a count.
For example, given the input "aabbbcc," the output should be "a2b3c2."

Task5
Given a palindromic string, modify it by replacing exactly one character with the lexicographically smallest
lowercase English letter, such that the resulting string is not a palindrome.
If no such modification is possible, return an empty string.

Example: There are many ways to make "abccba" not a palindrome, such as "zbccba", "aaccba", and "abacba"
